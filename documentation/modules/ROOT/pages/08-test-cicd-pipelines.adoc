== Check CI Web Hook

Let’s check if the webhook is working:

[.console-input]
[source,bash, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
oc logs -f deployment/el-events-ci-pl-push-{git-provider}-listener -n ${CICD_NAMESPACE}
----

You should get something like this.

[.console-output]
[source,bash, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
...
{"level":"info","ts":"2022-02-14T17:33:55.087Z","logger":"eventlistener","caller":"eventlistenersink/main.go:181","msg":"Listen and serve on port 8080","commit":"fbb0fd1","knative.dev/controller":"eventlistener"}
----

Now if you push a change in the code the CI pipeline for `events` should we kicked off.

For instance you can run this set of commands, in a new terminal.

[.console-input]
[source,bash, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
export USERNAME={username}
export GIT_URL={gitea-host}
git clone https://repository-gitea-system.apps. cluster-prhg6.prhg6.sandbox770.opentlc.com/user1/gramola-events
cd gramola-events
sed -i 's/info.name=gramola-events-/info.name=gramola-events-{username}/g' ./src/main/resources/application.properties

----


If you haven’t stopped the log output you should see something like:

[.console-input]
[source,bash, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
...
{"level":"info","ts":"2021-08-26T15:37:54.796Z","logger":"eventlistener","caller":"resources/create.go:95","msg":"Generating resource: kind: &APIResource{Name:pipelineruns,Namespaced:true,Kind:PipelineRun,Verbs:[delete deletecollection get list patch create update watch],ShortNames:[pr prs],SingularName:pipelinerun,Categories:[tekton tekton-pipelines],Group:tekton.dev,Version:v1beta1,StorageVersionHash:RcAKAgPYYoo=,}, name: events-ci-pl-push-plr-","knative.dev/controller":"eventlistener"}
{"level":"info","ts":"2021-08-26T15:37:54.796Z","logger":"eventlistener","caller":"resources/create.go:103","msg":"For event ID \"57d7515c-f954-43ee-b99b-bf53a1578058\" creating resource tekton.dev/v1beta1, Resource=pipelineruns","knative.dev/controller":"eventlistener"}
----

Stop the log output with `Ctrl+C`.

We have to do the same for the `gateway` service, you now the drill,
let’s get the route host got the listener.

[.console-input]
[source,bash, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
oc get route/el-gateway-ci-pl-push-listener -n ${CICD_NAMESPACE} -o jsonpath='{.status.ingress[0].host}' && echo ""
----

This time go to the `gramola-gateway` repo and create a webhook like we
did before but using the host you just got.

Again as we did for `gramola-events` let’s have a look to the logs of
the listener:

[.console-input]
[source,bash, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
oc logs -f deployment/el-gateway-ci-pl-push-listener -n ${CICD_NAMESPACE}
----

If it all went well you should see this:

[.console-input]
[source,bash, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
...
{"level":"info","ts":"2021-08-26T15:58:30.986Z","logger":"eventlistener","caller":"sink/sink.go:213","msg":"interceptor stopped trigger processing: rpc error: code = FailedPrecondition desc = event type ping is not allowed","knative.dev/controller":"eventlistener","/triggers-eventid":"bf2144ab-d3ca-471c-a340-9d9ae9e150e4","/trigger":"github-listener"}
----

Now make a change to the code of `gramola-gateway` and let’s see if the
pipeline is triggered or not.

[.console-input]
[source,bash, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
...
{"level":"info","ts":"2021-08-26T16:03:26.383Z","logger":"eventlistener","caller":"resources/create.go:95","msg":"Generating resource: kind: &APIResource{Name:pipelineruns,Namespaced:true,Kind:PipelineRun,Verbs:[delete deletecollection get list patch create update watch],ShortNames:[pr prs],SingularName:pipelinerun,Categories:[tekton tekton-pipelines],Group:tekton.dev,Version:v1beta1,StorageVersionHash:RcAKAgPYYoo=,}, name: gateway-ci-pl-push-plr-","knative.dev/controller":"eventlistener"}
{"level":"info","ts":"2021-08-26T16:03:26.383Z","logger":"eventlistener","caller":"resources/create.go:103","msg":"For event ID \"de0712e7-9d0e-4896-87a2-1058047fe7ce\" creating resource tekton.dev/v1beta1, Resource=pipelineruns","knative.dev/controller":"eventlistener"}
----

Now let's take a look at these pipelines in OpenShift console. Go to 'pipelines->events-ci-pl' and inside 'pipelineruns' open the run created by the webhook, you must see something like this:

image::pipeline-ci-run.png[Pipeline CI run]

As we can see the pipeline has been automatically triggered due to the repository update and a pull request must has been created in Gitea, let's check.

Go to Gitea and inside 'Gramola' repository there must be a pull request like 'Updating 'gramola-events' image for overlay 'dev' with new image', merge it:

image::gitea-merged-pr.png[Gitea merged PR]

Now the cd pipeline must be automatically triggered by this merged PR. Go to 'pipelines->events-cd-pl' and inside 'pipelineruns' open the run created after the merge, you must see something like this:

image::pipelines-events-cd.png[Pipeline events CD]

As we can see, this pipeline has updated the Gramola Events image with latest changes and has also created a new PR for test environment. You can validate these by doing:

- In you terminal execute the following command to view existing replica sets (update the user name):
  [.console-input]
  [source,bash, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
  ----
  oc get replicaset -n gramola-dev-*user*
  ----

  A new replica set has been created for 'gramola-events' in order to update the image version.

- Go to Gitea and inside 'Gramola' repository there must be a pull request like 'Updating 'gramola-events' image for overlay 'test' with new image'. You can merge to continue with the deployment process in test environment.

TODO Explain the web hook mechanism and add the diagram!!!

== End to End Pipeline Test

So, our web hooks are, apparently, working properly but we will never know for sure unless we make a change in the code and see if it all works as expected and we see that change being promoted through our environments.
