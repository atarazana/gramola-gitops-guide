== Checking pipelines

Well so far we have used the command line to create the ArgoCD root application that in its turn has created all the needed elements:

- Cluster Tasks
- Pipelines
- Triggers

All those elements have been created in namespace devoted to CICD, let's have a look at the pipelines. Open the OpenShift web console and navigate to the CICD project (_red arrow_).

NOTE: Make sure that on the upper left corner the "Administrator" view is selected and that you are in the *'Home->Projects'* section.

Now navigate to 'Pipelines->Pipelines'. As you can see there are CI and CD pipelines for each microservice.

image::pipelines-check-2.png[Pipelines Check 2]

Le's have a look to the *CI pipeline* for the `Events` microservice *'events-ci-pl'*. As you can see is made of a series of tasks:

- *fetch-repository:* Fetches the `Events` code fro the Gitea repository you migrated before
- *package:* Compiles and packages the code in a JAR file
- *build:* Builds a container image, pushes it to the registry of images and saves the hash in an output variable
- *fetch-config-repository:* Fetches the configuration of Gramola (remember git is the source of truth for ArgoCD)
- *update-image:* Updates the hash in the *kustomization file* in the `dev` overlay of `Events` but in a short lived feature branch
- *gitea-pr-create:* Creates a *Pull Request* with the *feature branch* over the *main branch*
- *github-pr-create:* _N/A in this case we use Gitea_

NOTE: This is just an example covering the bare minimum tasks of a CI pipeline! Of course there should be other critical tasks such as: unit testing, code quality, ...

image::pipelines-check-3.png[Pipelines Check 3]

Navigate back and open the *CD pipeline*, again for `Events`, called *'events-cd-pl'*. This time the list of tasks is even shorter...

- *argocd-sync:* This triggers both the refresh from the configuration git repository and the assets synchronization
- *fetch-config-repository:* Fetches the configuration of Gramola (remember git is the source of truth for ArgoCD)
- *update-image:* Updates the hash in the *kustomization file* in the `dev` overlay of `Events` but in a short lived feature branch
- *gitea-pr-create:* Creates a *Pull Request* with the *feature branch* over the *main branch*
- *github-pr-create:* _N/A in this case we use Gitea_

image::pipelines-check-4.png[Pipelines Check 4]

Finally if you navigate to 'Pipelines->Triggers' you'll see there are many of them, we'll only use those for Gitea but the example is ready for receiving events from GitHub and GitLab. 

image::pipelines-check-5.png[Pipelines Check 5]

Well triggers are in place but we need web hooks to feed them!

[#create-pipelines-web-hooks]
== Create Pipelines Web Hooks

include::partial$gitea-create-webhooks.adoc[]

== Creating Web Hooks for the Cd Pipelines

Continuos Delivery pipelines are triggered once a PR to the
configuration repository `gramola` changing the image of a deployment
has been merged. This means we have to create webhooks for this type of
event for all the services that comprises `gramola`, our application:

Go to github to the gramola repo:

Go to Settings

Go to Web Hooks

Annotate route to the CD pipeline, the one triggered with PR that
changes the image of `events`.

[.console-input]
[source,bash, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
oc get route/el-events-cd-pl-pr-gitea-listener -n ${CICD_NAMESPACE} -o jsonpath='{.status.ingress[0].host}' && echo ""
----

Expect something like:

[.console-input]
[source,bash, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
el-events-cd-pl-pr-gitea-listener-gramola-cicd.apps.acme.com
----

Create Web Hook (click on Add Webhook) - Payload URL, the URL of the
route of the trigger listener you just got (don’t forget the `http://`
part, it’s NOT `https://`) - Type a secret… any thing should work -
Click on Let me…. and select Pull Requests and deselect Push Events…

Click on `Add webhook`

Let’s check the webhook is working:

[.console-input]
[source,bash, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
oc logs -f deployment/el-events-cd-pl-pr-gitea-listener -n ${CICD_NAMESPACE}
----

You should get something like this, pay attention to one of the last
lines saying *``event type ping is not allowed''*.

We have to do the same for the `gateway` service… so annotate route to
the CD pipeline, the one triggered with PR that changes the image of
`gateway`.
