[#source-of-truth]
== Source Of Truth

As we have already exposed in GitOps Git is the source of truth so we need one to start with... you may have your own but for the sake of homogeneity in this guide we're going to use a git server deployed in OpenShift.

Why not relying on a preexisting git server somewhere you may ask? This is so, because in order to execute the pipelines section of this guide you have to fork some git repositories.

[NOTE]
====
This is necessary because:

- webhooks need to be created and obviously you need permissions on them
- you want to make changes to the code and promote those changes across environments
====

These are the repositories you need to fork:

- *Configuration Repo:* https://github.com/atarazana/gramola.git
- *Events Microservice:* https://github.com/atarazana/gramola-events.git
- *Gateway Microservice:* https://github.com/atarazana/gramola-gateway.git

You could fork them in your preferred git server, but for the sake of simplicity we're going to give you instructions to deploy a git server in OpenShift and for them there.

[#deploying-gitea]
== Deploying Gitea

Run this command to deploy the Gitea operator and Gitea itself in your OpenShift cluster.

NOTE: Gitea will be installed in `gitea-system` namespace

[.console-input]
[source,bash, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
until kubectl apply -k util/gitea/; do sleep 2; done
----

The previous command will retry until it's all installed but *we still need to check if it all works properly*.

include::partial$gitea-tests.adoc[]

[#create-git-users]
== Create Git Users

Now that Gitea is installed and up and running, it's time to add some users in the cluster, to do so we're going to create a `Job` that will in it's turn create 20 users.

[.console-input]
[source,bash, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
kustomize build util/setup/ | sed -e 's/^  name\:.*$//g' | kubectl create -f -
----

If you just want to create one user do this.

[#explore-gitea-console]
== Explore Gitea Console

Before we continue with the migration of the git repositories of our application open the console and check that your credentials are valid and all looks good. Open https://{gitea-host}[^] and use these credentials: 

- *USERNAME:* {username}
- *PASSWORD:* {password}

You should see something like this. Please enter your credentials and hit the green button.

[#create-git-pat]
== Create Git PAT

Let's create a *Personal Access Token* (PAT) in Gitea for user *{username}*.

include::partial$gitea-create-pat.adoc[]

[#migrate-repositories]
== Migrate Repositories

Now that user *{username}* has been created let's migrate `gramola` repositories into Gitea.

include::partial$gitea-migrate-repos.adoc[]

After successfully migrating all the repos you should see this in the Gitea console.
